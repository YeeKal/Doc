## project

**GraspIt**

By modeling an object as a set of shape primitives (spheres, cylinders, cones and boxes) we can use a set of rules to generate a set of grasp starting positions and pregrasp shapes that can then be tested on the object model.

**visual-pushing-grasping**

Train robotic agents to learn to plan pushing and grasping actions for manipulation with deep reinforcement learning.
