## permalink

Setting permalink styles in your configuration file applies the setting globally in your project. You configure permalinks in your \_config.yml file like this:

```css
`permalink: /:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title.html`

//defaule value

Setting the permalink in posts pages or collection's font matter overrides any global settingd.
