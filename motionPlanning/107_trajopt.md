> trajopt is a software framework for generating robot trajectories by local optimization.
> 
> The following core capabilities are included:
>
>1. a solver for non-convex optimization problems, using sequential convex optimization.
>2. cost and constraint functions for kinematics and collision avoidance
>3. constructing problems from JSON-based specification format
