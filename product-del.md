You can prompt AI using your space bar,\nhighlighting text and selecting \Ask AI\, or via slash commands. You must\ntake action for AI to activate.\n\nIt will not generate content or send requests to our AI providers unless you\nperform one of the actions above. You are in control.\n\nHow is Notion AI different from other AI tools?\n\nNotion certainly isn’t the only AI-powered tool out there. But here’s what\nmakes Notion AI special:\n\n  * Artificial intelligence becomes more useful when it’s integrated across the place where you’re already doing your work, storing notes & docs, and collaborating with others. No need to switch back and forth between your notes and a separate AI-powered tool.\n\n  * Compared to other tools, Notion has a unique and highly flexible drag-and-drop text editor, where any AI-generated content can be easily rearranged and transformed. Over time, Notion AI will be able to take advantage of even more Notion features.\n\n  * Today, Notion AI has many uses across your notes and docs. But Notion can do a lot more than just notes — we’ll continue to expand Notion AI’s capabilities to help with project management and your team knowledge base in the future. This is just the beginning!\n\nHow does Notion AI use my data?\n\nWe follow our standard data protection practices to keep your data encrypted\nand private.\n\nThe Notion AI Writing Suite will not use your data to train our models unless\nyou opt in to a request to share your data. Any information used to power\nNotion AI will be shared with our partners for the sole purpose of providing\nyou with the Notion AI features.\n\nFor more information, see the Notion AI Supplementary Terms.\n\nHow much usage is included with the Notion AI add-on plan?\n\nWhen you purchase the Notion AI add-on, you’re enabling everyone in your\nworkspace (except for guests) to have unlimited use of Notion AI.\n\nTo ensure optimal performance and fair usage across all Notion AI users, your\naccess to AI features can be reduced depending on your usage.\n\nIs there a free trial for Notion AI?\n\nEveryone can use Notion AI for free, so you can test its capabilities before\npurchasing the add-on subscription. The number of complimentary AI responses\nincreases with the more members you have, and is shared among the entire\nworkspace.\n\nOnce you\'ve used all your complimentary AI responses, you will see a message\nthat a Notion AI add-on subscription is necessary to continue using AI\nfeatures. You’ll need to be a workspace owner, and on desktop, to add Notion\nAI to your plan.\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Info© 2024 Notion Labs, Inc.\n\n  * Company\n\n  * About us\n  * Careers\n  * Security\n  * Status\n  * Terms & privacy\n\n  * Download\n\n  * iOS & Android\n  * Mac & Windows\n  * Calendar\n  * Web Clipper\n\n  * Resources\n\n  * Help center\n  * Pricing\n  * Blog\n  * Community\n  * Integrations\n  * Templates\n  * Affiliates\n\n  * Notion for\n\n  * Enterprise\n  * Small business\n  * Personal\n  * Explore more→\n\n\n\n
