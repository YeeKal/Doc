**dextrous workspace**: the end-effector can reach with all orientations.

**reachable workspace**: the robot can reach at least one orientation.

## closed-form solution

Another solution strategies are called **numerical solutions**. The iterative numerical solution generally are much slower. 

Two main approach: **algebraic** and **geometric**.
